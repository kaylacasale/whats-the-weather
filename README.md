Weather data has many applications and holds importance in our lives. From helping individuals prepare for how to dress (i.e. warm weather, cold weather, rain, etc.) to helping farmers plan for crop irrigation and protection, the value of reliable, on-demand weather data is ever-growing. Especially in times of climate change and growing poltical awareness of our environment, accessing data about the conditions that surround us will only be more important going into the future. 

How weather works is a natural phenomenon that scientists cannot control. While it is impossible, as of now, to fully manipulate weather conditions- it is possible to know what they are and what they will be. Giving certainty to your day or week starts by understanding the physical conditions around you, and adjusting accordingly. 

## About
